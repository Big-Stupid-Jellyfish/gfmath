		Battle Spirits Saga is a 2023 remaster/remake of the Battle Spirits card game, originally released in 2008/2009.

</p>

<span class="anchor" id="intro"></span>
<h2>Introduction<sup><small><a href="#intro">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	In most card games, it's easy to compare statlines - just look at the overall pool of creatures with the same cost, and see how their power/toughness compares.
	LV4 monsters in Yugioh, for example, have 0-2000 ATK (assuming no negative effect), and 1700+ is usually considered solid.
	Many mana-based games have average power/toughness values approximately in line with play cost.
	In Battle Spirits Saga, this gets a little trickier - their spirits have <a href="https://battlespirits-saga.com/images/cards/card/BSS01-046.png">up to three levels</a> with different stats, with higher levels requiring more "cores" (in that case, for example, lv3 requires 6 cores and gives it 6000 BP).
	It can be hard to figure out if 2 cores for 4000 BP or 3 cores for 5000 BP is better.
</p>
<p>
	I've created charts for each spirit cost showing the distribution of BP/core requirements, to help compare statlines between spirits of the same cost.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="all"></span>
<h2>Cost 1-10 Charts - All Spirits<sup><small><a href="#all">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	These contain all spirits revealed through BSS06.
	All spirits so far only need 1 core for LV1, so that's presented as a bar chart.
	Cost reduction is similarly one-dimensional.
	"Frequency" is the count of spirits who have each listed cost reduction/lv1 BP stat.
	For levels 2/3, the scatter plot shows core/BP combinations with larger circles representing a greater number of spirits at that combination.
	These levels are combined into one chart - many spirits end up treating lv2 as their max, and it makes it easier to compare with the overall core:BP relationship.
	Spirits placing in the top-left region of those charts can be considered to have high stats.
</p>
<p>
	For example, looking at the cost 1 charts, we can see that about half of these spirits have 1 cost reduction. Around 3/4ths have 1000 BP at lv1.
	At higher levels, the max BP is 5000 (taking 4 or 5 cores).
	<!-- Most of these spirits have a lv2 that takes 2 or 3 cores for 2 or 3000 BP, with an approximately even distribution between them.
	The few spirits with a 2-core 4000 BP level 2 are above the curve stat-wise, and have no cost reduction or effect to compensate.
	If they do have a lv3 (which isn't many), it's almost always 3 cores for 4000 BP. -->

<p>
	For a usage example, <a href="images/bss-stats/cost4ex.png">here's where one random card stands</a>.
	Pretty much middle of the road for 4-cost spirits.
	Cost 0 not included yet as it's essentially all Elementals with the same stat profile.

<h2>Split by effects<sup><small><a href="#splite">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	One basic problem - we expect non-effect spirits to have better stats than usual. Let's pull those out.

<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2> -->

<span class="anchor" id="notes"></span>
<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<ul>
	<li>As the data pool grows, it may be interesting to compare by color and see if the stat distribution varies significantly.</li>
	<li>Similarly, a comparison by set/release date could, once enough sets release, show how much stat powercreep is present.</li>
	<li>
		Strength (or presence) of effects are not accounted for.
		Non-effect spirits should be held to a higher stat standard.
		Extreme cases like <a href="https://battlespirits-saga.com/images/cards/card/BSS01-015.png">Dilophoza</a> have much higher stats and a negative effect to balance it out.
		The reduction colors, symbol count, and so on also influence things.
	</li>
	<li>Stats obviously don't win many games on their own. This is just a way to help evaluate one facet of your spirits.</li>
	<!-- <li>Non-effect spirits make up a rather concerning ~25% of the spirit pool.</li> -->
</ul>
