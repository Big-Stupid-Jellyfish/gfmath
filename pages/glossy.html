<h2>The N/R Numbers<sup><small><a href="#numbers">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	If you click on the "odds" button displayed next to a pack, and scroll down to the bottom, you can find this table of glossy/royal chances:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/glossy/rates.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	Tentatively, we may assume these to be accurate for cards pulled from packs.
	There would likely be legal trouble otherwise, and I don't particularly care to crawl through masses of pack opening videos.
	But what about crafting?
	As far as I can tell, rates there are not disclosed anywhere in-game.
	Here's what Konami has to say about crafting:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/glossy/craftmenu.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	We might assume this to be the same as the rate from packs - that would be reasonable enough.
	But why assume when you can test?
	While SR/URs are too expensive to spam craft, I've been collecting my own data recently when trying to get glossy playsets of some random N/R cards.
	It looks something like this:
</p>
<center>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>Card</th>
			<th>Rarity</th>
			<th>Start count</th>
			<th>End count</th>
			<th>Glossy rate</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lifeless Leaffish</td>
			<td>R</td>
			<td>0/0/-</td>
			<td>33/3/-</td>
			<td>3/36</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shif, Fairy of the Ghoti</td>
			<td>R</td>
			<td>3/0/-</td>
			<td>97/2/-</td>
			<td>2/96</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Gold Pride - Roller Baller</td>
			<td>N</td>
			<td>2/0/-</td>
			<td>146/3/-</td>
			<td>3/147</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	... and so on.
</p>
<p>
	In total, 4709 craft attempts resulted in 245 glossy N/R cards - a 5.2% rate.
	The true glossy rate is almost surely (with 99% confidence) at least 4.4% but no more than 6.1%.
	5.00% is a reasonable guess for the true rate.
	Expect ~20 crafts per glossy, or ~60 for a playset - ~1200 N/R dust after refunds.
	The low rate means variance is relatively high, however.
	<!-- It's possible for SR/UR cards to have odds more in line with the stated rates from packs, but I would be very suspicious based on these results. -->
</p>

<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	
</p> -->
<h2>The SR/UR Numbers<sup><small><a href="#numbers">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	It takes an incredible amount of data to get a solid read on royal rates (as they're expected to be in the 1% range, I'd feel more comfortable with 10000+ samples), but glossy SR/URs are a bit more doable.
	From my data so far, 6131 SR/UR crafts resulted in 293 glossy cards (4.8%), and 58 royals (0.95%).
	We can't say much about the royal rate yet - it may be anywhere around 0.6-1.3%.
	1.00% is a somewhat reasonable guess, but I'm not sure I'd trust Konami to be that "fair."
	But this is more than enough to conclude the SR/UR glossy rate does <em>not</em> match the stated 9% odds from packs (p&lt;0.00001).
	With 99% confidence, the true SR/UR glossy rate is between 4.1% and 5.5%.
	Comparing with the N/R data, it seems fairly likely crafting in general has a 5.00% rate of giving a glossy finish.
	No significant difference has been detected between SR and UR rates (with 4137 and 1994 crafts, respectively).
</p>
<p>
	If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say the overall probabilities currently look like:

<!-- <p>
	The reduced UR glossy rates are incredibly suspicious.
	As I'm not sure glossies hold much value for whales, I'm inclined to believe these rates were reduced so that players get less UR dust from dismantling their cards, on average.
	This attitude is at least reflected in other areas (reluctance to hit problematic UR cards, inflated rarities newly-released archetypes).
</p> -->
<p>
	Be careful when spending your dust, and be even more careful when deciding whether or not to spend your dollars.
	While current evidence doesn't show tampering with the royal rates, the definite, misleading tampering with glossy rates across the board does not inspire trust.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="notes"></span>
<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Some people, when it comes to probability, like to come up with increasingly bizarre justifications on what influences the result.
	Maybe you get better odds if you craft exactly on the hour, with a left-hand mouse.
	Maybe you get worse odds if you have at least 3 royal rare cards in the archetype.
	Without evidence these are equally worthless, but I will head off one variation - the batch size does not appear to matter.
	It's a somewhat smaller sample (and more annoying to collect), but my experimental glossy rate for N/R cards is about the same whether 3 are crafted at once or only 1
	(10/212 glossy with batch size 1, reject a 10% glossy rate with p&lt;0.02).
	Boost generation similarly shows no difference in odds.
</p>
<p>
	It should be obvious at this point, but these results are far beyond what "poor luck" could explain.
	Most tests with this data will give p-values below many software packages' machine epsilon.
	For a more precise example, a result as extreme as the latest UR+SR glossy data (294 of 6131) would have a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=binomial+probability&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22x%22%7D+-%3E%22295%22&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22n%22%7D+-%3E%226131%22&assumption=%7B%22C%22%2C+%22binomial+probability%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22Formula%22%2C+%22dflt%22%7D&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22p%22%7D+-%3E%220.09%22">probability of occurring, given a 9% glossy rate, of ~3.7e-36</a>.
	Things <em>that</em> unlikely simply do not happen.
	<!-- Of course, another explanation would be that I'm screwing up the data collection somehow. But obviously I don't believe that to be the case, and I'd hope you'd have at least a little trust in me. :) -->
</p>
<!-- <p>
	This article is likely to be periodically updated as I craft more glossy cards, and can better narrow down the true rate.
</p> -->
<p>
	I am also collecting data on UR/SR crafts, but that will take much longer to get a respectable sample (especially for royal rares).
	If you would like to contribute, feel free to message me.
	I'll periodically update this page as my sample size improves.
	Most critically, any submitted data must be decided as "data to submit" <em>before</em> the crafting takes place.
</p>
<p>
	I have done some testing on glossy rates from packs.
	Unsurprisingly, these do align with the stated in-game odds (9-10% depending on rarity).
	Not much to say there, there would likely be legal trouble in certain areas if they were lying about that, as gems are a paid currency.
